<b>Introduction to the Depp</b>

<br>
<pre>John Christopher Depp II (born June 9, 1963) is an American actor, producer and musician. He is the recipient of multiple accolades, including a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award, in addition to nominations for three Academy Awards and two BAFTAs.

    Depp made his feature film debut in the horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and appeared in Platoon (1986), before rising to prominence as a teen idol on the television series 21 Jump Street (1987–1990). In the 1990s, Depp acted mostly in independent films with auteur directors, often playing eccentric characters. These included Cry-Baby (1990), What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Benny and Joon (1993), Dead Man (1995), Donnie Brasco (1997), and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998). Depp also began his longtime collaboration with director Tim Burton, portraying the leads in the films Edward Scissorhands (1990), Ed Wood (1994), and Sleepy Hollow (1999).
    
    In the 2000s, Depp became one of the most commercially successful film stars by playing Captain Jack Sparrow in the Walt Disney swashbuckler film series Pirates of the Caribbean (2003–2017). He also received critical praise for Chocolat (2000), Finding Neverland (2004) and Public Enemies (2009), while also continuing his commercially successful collaboration with Tim Burton with the films Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), where he portrayed Willy Wonka, Corpse Bride (2005), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), and Alice in Wonderland (2010).
    
    In 2012, Depp was one of the world's biggest film stars,[1][2] and was listed by the Guinness World Records as the world's highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75 million in a year.[3] During the 2010s Depp began producing films through his company Infinitum Nihil. He also received critical praise for Black Mass (2015) and formed the rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry, before starring as Gellert Grindelwald in the Wizarding World films Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016), and Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018).
    
    Between 1998 and 2012, Depp was in a relationship with French singer Vanessa Paradis; they have two children together, including actress Lily-Rose Depp. From 2015 to 2017, Depp was married to actress Amber Heard. Their divorce drew much media attention as both alleged abuse against each other. In 2018, Depp unsuccessfully sued the publishers of British tabloid The Sun for defamation under English law; a judge ruled the publication labelling him a "wife beater" was "substantially true". Depp later successfully sued Heard in a 2022 trial in Virginia; a seven-member jury ruled that Heard's allegations of "sexual violence" and "domestic abuse" were false and defamed Depp under American law.[4][5]</pre>

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <pre>John Christopher Depp II was born on June 9, 1963, in Owensboro, Kentucky,[6][7][8] the youngest of four children of waitress Betty Sue Palmer (née Wells)[9] and civil engineer John Christopher Depp.[10][11] Depp's family moved frequently during his childhood, eventually settling in Miramar, Florida, in 1970.[12] His parents divorced in 1978 when he was 15,[12][13] and his mother later married Robert Palmer, whom Depp has called "an inspiration".[14][15]

        Depp's mother gave him a guitar when he was 12, and he began playing in various bands.[12] He dropped out of Miramar High School at 16 in 1979 to become a rock musician. He attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician.[12] In 1980, Depp began playing in a band called The Kids. After modest local success in Florida, the band moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing its name to Six Gun Method. In addition to the band, Depp worked a variety of odd jobs, such as in telemarketing. In December 1983, Depp married makeup artist Lori Anne Allison,[7] the sister of his band's bassist and singer. The Kids split up before signing a record deal in 1984, and Depp began collaborating with the band Rock City Angels.[16] He co-wrote their song "Mary", which appeared on their debut Geffen Records album Young Man's Blues.[17] Depp and Allison divorced in 1985.[7]
        
        Depp is of primarily English descent, with some French, German, and Irish ancestry.[18] His surname comes from a French Huguenot immigrant, Pierre Dieppe, who settled in Virginia around 1700. In interviews in 2002 and 2011, Depp claimed to have Native American ancestry, saying: "I guess I have some Native American somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American. She grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek Indian".[19] Depp's claims came under scrutiny when Indian Country Today wrote that Depp had never inquired about his heritage or been recognized as a member of the Cherokee Nation.[20] This led to criticism from the Native American community, as Depp has no documented Native ancestry,[20] and Native community leaders consider him "a non-Indian".[20][21] Depp's choice to portray Tonto, a Native American character, in The Lone Ranger was criticized,[20][21] along with his choice to name his rock band "Tonto's Giant Nuts".[22][23][24][25] During the promotion for The Lone Ranger, Depp was formally adopted as an honorary son by LaDonna Harris, a member of the Comanche Nation, making him an honorary member of her family but not a member of any tribe.[26] Depp's Comanche name given at the adoption was "Mah Woo May", which means shape shifter.[27] Critical response to his claims from the Native community increased after this, including satirical portrayals of Depp by Native comedians.[23][24][25] An ad featuring Depp and Native American imagery, by Dior for the fragrance "Sauvage", was pulled in 2019 after being accused of cultural appropriation and racism.[28][29][30][31]
